Conventions
======

Naming is really important!

1. Interface names : CanXYZ for verbs, XYZ for data accessors

2. Table names : plural, lowercase, underscores (?)

3. Migration names : pivots use double underscore, alter => "alter" vs create, up/down

4. Controller names : method and return type. What to use for return type convention?
